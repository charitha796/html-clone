        <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard <a href="Markup_language.htm">markup language</a> for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as <a href="Cascading_Style_Sheets.htm">Cascading Style Sheets</a> (CSS) and scripting languages such as <a href="JavaScript">JavaScript.</a> </p>
        <p><a href="Web_browser.htm">Web Browser</a>  receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>
          <p><a href="HTML_element.htm">HTML Elements</a> are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as &lt;img&gt; and &lt;input&gt; directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as &lt;p&gt; surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>

        <p>HTML can embed programs written in a <a href="Scripting_language.htm">scripting language</a> such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The <a href="World_Wide_Web_Consortium.htm">World Wide Web Consortium </a>(W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[3] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the &lt;canvas&gt; element, together with JavaScript.</p>

        <h2>History</h2><hr>
        <b>Deployment</b>
        <p>In 1980, physicist <a href="Tim_Berners-Lee.htm">Tim Berners-Lee</a>, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[4] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an  <a href="Encyclopedia.htm">encyclopedia</a> is the first entry.[5]</p>

        <p>The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags",[6] first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[7][8] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by CERN SGML, an in-house  <a href="Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language.htm">Standard Generalized Markup Language</a> (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.[9]</p>

        <p>HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visible or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements are mentioned in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which describes the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the <a href="TYPSET_and_RUNOFF.htm">RUNOFF command</a> developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system. These formatting commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with separate structure and markup. HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.</p>

      <h3>HTML-2</h3>
              <b>November 24, 1995</b>
              <p>HTML 2.0 was published as <a href="Request_for_Comments.htm">RFC</a> 1866. Supplemental RFCs added capabilities:</p>

      <ul>
            <li><strong>November 24, 1995:</strong> HTML 2.0 was published as <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1866"   target="_blank">RFC 1866</a>.</li>

      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p><strong>HTML 3.2</strong> was published as a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html32" target="_blank" title="HTML 3.2 W3C Recommendation">W3C Recommendation</a> on January 14, 1997. It was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by the W3C, following the closure of the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/" target="_blank" title="Internet Engineering Task Force">IETF</a>'s HTML Working Group on September 12, 1996. Initially code-named <em>"Wilbur"</em>, HTML 3.2 dropped support for math formulas entirely, reconciled overlapping proprietary extensions, and adopted most of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape" target="_blank" title="Netscape browser">Netscape</a>'s visual markup tags. However, Netscape's <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> element and Microsoft's <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> element were omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two companies. A markup language for mathematical formulas, similar to HTML, was standardized 14 months later as <a href="https://www.w3.org/Math/" target="_blank" title="MathML standard for mathematical markup">MathML</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>HTML 4.0</strong> was published as a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/" target="_blank" title="HTML 4.0 W3C Recommendation">W3C Recommendation</a> on December 18, 1997. It offered three variations: <strong>Strict</strong>, in which deprecated elements are forbidden; <strong>Transitional</strong>, in which deprecated elements are allowed; and <strong>Frameset</strong>, which primarily supports frame-related elements. Initially code-named <em>"Cougar"</em>, HTML 4.0 adopted many browser-specific element types and attributes, while phasing out Netscape's visual markup features by marking them as deprecated in favor of style sheets. HTML 4 is an SGML application conforming to <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/16387.html" target="_blank" title="ISO 8879 – SGML standard">ISO 8879 – SGML</a>.</p>

      <p>On April 24, 1998, HTML 4.0 was reissued with minor edits without incrementing the version number. Later, on December 24, 1999, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html401/" target="_blank" title="HTML 4.01 W3C Recommendation">HTML 4.01</a> was published as a W3C Recommendation, offering the same three variations as HTML 4.0. Its last errata were published on May 12, 2001.</p>

<p>
  In May 2000, 
  <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/25580.html" target="_blank" title="ISO HTML standard">ISO/IEC 15445:2000</a> 
  ("ISO HTML", based on HTML 4.01 Strict) was published as an international standard. This standard falls under the domain of 
  <a href="https://www.iso.org/committee/45342.html" target="_blank" title="ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 34">ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 34</a>, 
  the subcommittee for document description and processing languages.
</p>

<p>
  After HTML 4.01, no new versions of HTML were released for several years, as the W3C's HTML Working Group shifted focus to developing the XML-based language 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHTML" target="_blank" title="XHTML on Wikipedia">XHTML</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>HTML5</strong> was published as a 
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/" target="_blank" title="HTML5 W3C Recommendation">W3C Recommendation</a> 
  on October 28, 2014. It was followed by 
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/" target="_blank" title="HTML 5.1 W3C Recommendation">HTML 5.1</a> 
  on November 1, 2016, and 
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/" target="_blank" title="HTML 5.2 W3C Recommendation">HTML 5.2</a> 
  on December 14, 2017.
</p>

<p>
  The <strong>HTML draft version timeline</strong> began in October 1991 with 
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html-spec/html-spec_toc.html" target="_blank" title="Original HTML Tags document">HTML Tags</a>, 
  an informal CERN document listing 18 tags. In June 1992, the first informal draft of the HTML DTD was released, followed by seven revisions. 
  By November 1992, HTML DTD 1.1 was introduced as the first versioned draft. In June 1993, the 
  <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-html-spec-00" target="_blank" title="Hypertext Markup Language Internet Draft">Hypertext Markup Language</a> 
  was published by the IETF IIIR Working Group as an Internet Draft, replaced a month later by a second version.
</p>

<p>
  In November 1993, 
  <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-htmlplus-00" target="_blank" title="HTML+ Internet Draft">HTML+</a> 
  was published as a competing proposal but expired in July 1994. The first draft of HTML 2.0 was published by the IETF in November 1994, eventually leading to 
  <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1866" target="_blank" title="RFC 1866 – HTML 2.0">RFC 1866</a> in November 1995.
</p>

<p>
  In April 1995, 
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html3/html3.txt" target="_blank" title="HTML 3.0 Proposal">HTML 3.0</a> 
  was proposed to the IETF but expired five months later. It included features from 
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/htmlplus/" target="_blank" title="HTML+ proposal">HTML+</a>, 
  such as tables, text flow around figures, and mathematical formulas. The W3C began developing the 
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/Arena/" target="_blank" title="Arena browser testbed">Arena browser</a> 
  as a testbed for HTML 3 and CSS. However, HTML 3.0 did not succeed due to its size (150 pages), rapid browser development, and limited IETF resources. 
  Browser vendors like Microsoft and Netscape implemented different subsets of HTML 3 features and introduced their own extensions, sparking the 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars" target="_blank" title="Browser wars on Wikipedia">browser wars</a>.
</p>

<p>These extensions included stylistic controls such as text color, background texture, font size, and font face—features that many in the academic community believed were outside the scope of HTML. As W3C Fellow <a href="https://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/" target="_blank" title="Dave Raggett profile">Dave Raggett</a> noted, "To a certain extent, Microsoft built its business on the Web by extending HTML features.</p>

<strong>January 2008</strong>
<p><a href="HTML_element.htm">HTML5</a> was published as a Working Draft by the W3C.[49]
Although its syntax closely resembles that of SGML, HTML5 has abandoned any attempt to be an SGML application and has explicitly defined its own "html" serialization, in addition to an alternative XML-based XHTML5 serialization.[50]</p>

<strong>2011 HTML5 – Last Call</strong>
<p>On 14 February 2011, the W3C extended the charter of its HTML Working Group with clear milestones for HTML5. In May 2011, the working group advanced HTML5 to "Last Call", an invitation to communities inside and outside W3C to confirm the technical soundness of the specification. The W3C developed a comprehensive test suite to achieve broad interoperability for the full specification by 2014, which was the target date for recommendation.[51] In January 2011, the WHATWG renamed its "HTML5" living standard to "HTML". The W3C nevertheless continued its project to release HTML5.[52]</p>

      <strong>2012 HTML5 – Candidate Recommendation</strong>
      <p>In July 2012, WHATWG and W3C decided on a degree of separation. W3C will continue the HTML5 specification work, focusing on a single definitive standard, which is considered a "snapshot" by WHATWG. The WHATWG organization will continue its work with HTML5 as a "Living Standard". The concept of a living standard is that it is never complete and is always being updated and improved. New features can be added but functionality will not be removed.[53]
      In December 2012, W3C designated HTML5 as a Candidate Recommendation.[54] The criterion for advancement to W3C Recommendation is "two 100% complete and fully interoperable implementations".[55]</p>

      <h3>Markup</h3><hr>
      <p>HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;/h1&gt;, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example &lt;img&gt;. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="code-box">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br>
&lt;html&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;head&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title&gt;This is a title&lt;/title&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/head&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;body&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p&gt;Hello world!&lt;/p&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/body&gt;<br>
&lt;/html&gt;
  </div>

  <p>The text between &lt;html&gt; and &lt;/html&gt; describes the web page, and the text between &lt;body&gt; and &lt;/body&gt; is the visible page content. The markup text &lt;title&gt;This is a title &lt;/title&gt; defines the browser page title shown on browser tabs and window titles and the tag &lt;div&gt; defines a division of the page used for easy styling. Between &lt;head&gt; and &lt;/head&gt;, a &lt;meta&gt; element can be used to define webpage metadata.

The Document Type Declaration <!DOCTYPE html> is for HTML5. If a declaration is not included, various browsers will revert to "quirks mode" for rendering.[72]</p>
<div>
<h3>Elements</h3>
<p>Main article: <a href="HTML_elementss.htm">HTML elements</a></p>
<p>HTML documents imply a structure of nested <a href="HTML_elementss.htm">HTML elements</a>. These are indicated in the document by HTML tags, enclosed in angle brackets.</p>
<p>In the simple, general case, the extent of an element is indicated by a pair of tags: a "start tag" &lt;p&gt; and "end tag" &lt;/p&gt;. The text content of the element, if any, is placed between these tags.
<p>Tags may also enclose further tag markup between the start and end, including a mixture of tags and text. This indicates further (nested) elements, as children of the parent element.</p>
<p>The start tag may also include the element's attributes within the tag. These indicate other information, such as identifiers for sections within the document, identifiers used to bind style information to the presentation of the document, and for some tags such as the <img> used to embed images, the reference to the image resource in the format like this: &lt;img src="example.com/example.jpg"&gt;
</p>
<h3>Element Examples</h3>
<p>See also <a href="HTML_elementss.htm">HTML elements</a></p>

    &lt;/head&gt;
  </div>

  <div class="section-title">Headings</div>
  <div class="explanation">
    HTML headings are defined with the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> tags with H1 being the highest (or most important) level and H6 the least:
  </div>

  <div class="heading-box">
    &lt;h1&gt;Heading level 1&lt;/h1&gt;<br>
    &lt;h2&gt;Heading level 2&lt;/h2&gt;<br>
    &lt;h3&gt;Heading level 3&lt;/h3&gt;<br>
    &lt;h4&gt;Heading level 4&lt;/h4&gt;<br>
    &lt;h5&gt;Heading level 5&lt;/h5&gt;<br>
    &lt;h6&gt;Heading level 6&lt;/h6&gt;
  </div>
</div>
<b>These effects are:</b>
<h1>Heading Level 1</h1><hr>
<h2>Heading Level 2</h2><hr>
<h3>Heading Level 3</h3>
<h4>Heading Level 4</h4>
<h5>Heading Level 5</h5>
<h6>Heading Level 6</h6>
<p>Structural markup indicates the purpose of text</p>
<p>For example, <h2>Golf</h2> establishes "Golf" as a second-level heading. Structural markup does not denote any specific rendering, but most web browsers have default styles for element formatting. Content may be further styled using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).</p>
<b>Presentational markup indicates the appearance of the text, regardless of its purpose:</b>

<p>For example, bold text indicates that visual output devices should render "boldface" in bold text, but gives a little indication what devices that are unable to do this (such as aural devices that read the text aloud) should do. In the case of both bold text and italic text, there are other elements that may have equivalent visual renderings but that are more semantic in nature, such as strong text and emphasized text respectively. It is easier to see how an aural user agent should interpret the latter two elements. However, they are not equivalent to their presentational counterparts: it would be undesirable for a screen reader to emphasize the name of a book, for instance, but on a screen, such a name would be italicized. Most presentational markup elements have become deprecated under the HTML 4.0 specification in favor of using CSS for styling.</p>
